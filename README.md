# NotebookApp

This is my first RESTfull (I hope) project on Java using basic stack of technologies: 
Spring Boot, Apache Maven, Spring Data JPA, MySQL and Thymeleaf + bootstrap on view side.

It's a simple CRUD service for managing custom notes.
You can view, add, update, delete, filter and sort your notes.
